## Fixes

# dbt_hubspot v0.6.2
## Under the Hood
- Updated the docs as there were issues with the previous deployment. ([#82](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot/pull/82))
- Introduced a GitHub workflow to ensure docs are re-built prior to merges to `main`. ([#82](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot/pull/82))
# dbt_hubspot v0.6.1

# dbt_hubspot v0.6.0
## ðŸŽ‰ Documentation and Feature Updates
- Updated README documentation updates for easier navigation and setup of the dbt package ([#67](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot/pull/67)).
- Included `hubspot_[source_table_name]_identifier` variable for additional flexibility within the package when source tables are named differently ([#67](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot/pull/67)).
- Adds `hubspot_ticket_deal_enabled` variable (default value=`False`) to disable modelling and testing of the `ticket_deal` source table. If there are no associations between tickets and deals in your Hubspot environment, this table will not exist ([#79](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot_source/pull/79)).

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- The `hubspot__deal_stages` model has undergone two major changes ([#78](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot/pull/78)):
  1. The stage and pipeline label columns now reflect where the deal was at a certain point of time (from `date_stage_entered` to `date_stage_exited`). Previously, this information reflected the deal's _current_ stage and pipeline in every record associated with the deal.
  2. This model previously passed through _all_ fields from the parent deals model. We removed these fields, as they are all present in `hubspot__deals` final model and do not change across deal stages. If you would like to join `DEAL` fields into the `hubspot__deal_stages` model, join `hubspot__deal_stages` with `hubspot__deals` on `deal_id`.
- Consistently renames `property_dealname`, `property_closedate`, and `property_createdate` to `deal_name`, `closed_at`, and `created_at`, respectively, in the `deals` model. Previously, if `hubspot__pass_through_all_columns = true`, only the prefix `property_` was removed from the names of these fields, while they were completely renamed to `deal_name`, `closed_at`, and `created_at` if `hubspot__pass_through_all_columns = false` ([#79](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot_source/pull/79)).

# dbt_hubspot v0.5.4
## Fixes
- Typo fix and spelling correction within the README. ([#70](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot/pull/70))
- Spelling correction of the variable names within the README. ([#74](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot/pull/74))

# dbt_hubspot v0.5.3
## Under the Hood
- Added integration testing to support the new `stg_hubspot__deal_contact` model to the `dbt_hubspot_source` package.
- Updated the below models such that the respective `lead()` functions also account for `field_name` in partitions
  - `hubspot__contact_history`
  - `hubspot__company_history`
  - `hubspot__deal_history`
- Added test cases for the above models that can be found, respectively, in: 
  - `models/marketing/history/history.yml`
  - `models/sales/history/history.yml`
# dbt_hubspot v0.5.2
## Under the Hood
- Updated the `engagements_joined` [macro](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot/blob/main/macros/engagements_joined.sql) to conditionally include relevant fields if their respective variables are enabled. Previously if a variable was disabled then the `hubspot__engagement_calls` model, which depends on the `engagements_joined` macro, would error out on the missing fields that were from the disabled variables. ([#65](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot/pull/65))

# dbt_hubspot v0.5.1
## Under the Hood
- Modified the join conditions within the `deal_fields_joined` cte of int_hubspot__deals_enhanced model to leverage the more appropriate `left join` rather than the `using` condition. This is to allow for correct and accurate joins across warehouses. ([#60](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot/pull/60))

# dbt_hubspot v0.5.0
ðŸŽ‰ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_hubspot_source`. Additionally, the latest `dbt_hubspot_source` package has a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

# dbt_hubspot v0.1.0 -> v0.4.1
Refer to the relevant release notes on the Github repository for specific details for the previous releases. Thank you!
